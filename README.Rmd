# projdir

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **projdir** is to provide **convenience functions to streamline the** 
**process of early project development** in R focusing mainly on creation of blank 
sub-directories and files and thus creating a similar basic framework across 
different projects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of projdir from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/AkashMer/projdir) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AkashMer/projdir")
```

## Example

One of the functions are `createFramework()` which by default creates the 
following blank sub-directories if not already present,

* **data** - to store all the data for your project.
* **R** - to store all your R scripts and Rmarkdowns.
* **results** - to store the results of your project.
